 *
 * Extracted from `orchestrator/production/analysts-adapter.ts` (PR #360
 * review) when a second caller appeared — the debate adapter's
 * failed-debate line (#364), which logs an `LlmClient` error whose message
 * can carry the provider's raw response body
 * (`shared/llm/nous-chat.ts`'s `buildApiError`). Two adapters
 * hand-rolling the same pattern list is how one of them silently stops
 * matching a new credential shape.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. Only well-known credential SYNTAXES are masked
 * (`bot<digits>:<token>`, `Bearer <token>`, `key/secret/token/password/auth =
 * <value>`), never anything that merely looks random. Over-masking would put
 * us back where #358 started — a failure whose stated cause says nothing — so
 * a real failure like `computeIndicator: sma(14) needs 14 bars but received
 * 13` must pass through verbatim, and a test pins exactly that.
