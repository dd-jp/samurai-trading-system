/**
 * Tick loop (ticket #94) — fans a TickPlan out across instruments under a
 * concurrency cap. See docs/specs/orchestrator-spec.md (Module: Tick Runner,
 * Module: Determinism & Backtest) and docs/wayfinder/orchestrator-map.md
 * ("bounded parallelism, not fully sequential").
 *
 * The cap protects the LLM rate limit shared by Analysts/Debate (CLAUDE.md's
 * HARD STOP governs those, not Execution's broker calls). It bounds how many
 * instruments run their pipelines concurrently — never any single
 * instrument's internal latency budget, which the Debate Engine owns.
 *
 * `max_concurrent_instruments: 1` is the sequential mode walk-forward replay
 * needs: outcomes come back in plan order regardless of the cap, but a cap of
 * 1 also makes the interleaving of stage calls across instruments
 * deterministic.
